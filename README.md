Pydroid 3 tic-tac-toe Project, made for fun on Android

This is a very simple text-based tic-tac-toe program that I made with Pydroid 3 on Android just for fun.
The numbers 1-9 correspond to spaces on the board. Type a number to write an 'x' in that space. The game ends with either a win, lose or tie.
There is actually a trick to playing which can significantly increase your odds of winning against the AI. I thought about coding this out, but
I ultimately decided to leave it in as a method of strategy.
